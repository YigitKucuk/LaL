# LaL
A light-weight privacy browser that uses DuckDuckGo as the default search engine and blocks ads from thousands of ad hosts (sometimes ineffectively!)

Eventually, over 15 search engines will be added as well as DuckDuckGo

Next:
- Add a settings page (Set search engine, theme..)
- Add new search engines (Google, Yandex, Bing, Brave..)
- Make AdBlocker completely effective (It does not work on Youtube now)
- Block cookies (Basically an "I don't care about cookies")
- Create an informative page about web browsers and search engines (Which one to use?)
