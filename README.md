# LaL
A light-weight privacy browser that uses DuckDuckGo as the default search engine and blocks ads from over 20 thousand ad hosts (sometimes ineffectively!)

Eventually, over 15 search engines will be added as well as DuckDuckGo

Next:
- Add a settings page
- Add new search engines
- Make AdBlocker completely effective
- Block cookies
- Create an informative page about web browsers and search engines
